This is my first C++ program, written in C++98: 
        a classic PhoneBook, inspired by an assignmnt from 42Wolfsburg.
        
It brings the retro charm of the 80ies straight to your terminal: minimalistic, functional and oldschool.

Features: 
- Store up to 8 contacts. If you add more, the oldest one gets replaced. No dynamic memory, only hard limits :-)
- Supports the following commands:
        - ADD           -> add a new contact
        - SEARCH        -> displays a clean list of contacts with the option to view details
        - DELETE        -> Remove contacts  
        - DISPLAY ALL   -> view all stored contacts
        - EXIT          -> exit the program, all contacts are lost forever :D
